# Self-Supervised-Dual-Network-for-Cross-Domain-Optic-Disc-and-Cup-Segmentation
We propose a novel Self-Supervised Dual Network (SSDN) for OD and OC segmentation, which not only can handle domain discrepancies via separate sub-networks, but also retain cross-domain consistency through self-supervised and contrastive learning. We will make our code public once our paper is accepted by TMI.
